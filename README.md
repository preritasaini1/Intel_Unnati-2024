# Problem Statement 9 - ** Detect Pixelated image and correct it **
-This project gives an idea of image processing, where we find an image pixelated or not, and if it is pixelated, we correct it by using deep learning models. In this project, we've explored robust methods of deep learning models like CNN and SRCNN that are especially used for enhancing images. underscore the efficacy of these approaches in enhancing the images, removing the blurriness of the image, de-pixelating the image, and paving the way for applications in diverse fields with promising avenues for future advancements.
